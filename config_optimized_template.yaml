# Factory Simulation Configuration - OPTIMIZED
# ============================================
# This is a TEMPLATE for your optimized configuration.
# Copy this file to config_optimized.yaml and modify the parameters
# based on your analysis.
#
# Document your changes and reasoning in your optimization report.

# General Simulation Parameters (DO NOT MODIFY)
simulation:
  duration_hours: 168          # Keep same as baseline for comparison
  random_seed: 42              # Keep same for reproducibility
  debug_mode: false

# Order Arrival Parameters (DO NOT MODIFY)
order_arrival:
  interarrival_time_hours: 0.5  # Keep same - this is the demand rate

# Parts Warehouse Parameters
# TODO: Analyze if parts availability is a constraint
parts_warehouse:
  initial_parts: 500            # Consider: Is starting inventory sufficient?
  capacity: 1000                # Consider: Do we need more storage?
  replenishment_interval_hours: 24  # Consider: More frequent deliveries?
  replenishment_quantity: 500   # Consider: Larger deliveries?

# Production Line Parameters
production_line:
  # TODO: Analyze buffer utilization - are items waiting in queues?
  buffer_A_B_size: 10           # Consider: Increase if Machine A is blocked
  buffer_B_C_size: 10           # Consider: Increase if Machine B is blocked
  
  machines:
    - name: "Machine A"
      processing_time_minutes: 5    # Consider: Can this be reduced?
      mtbf_hours: 10                # FIXED - cannot modify
      mttr_hours: 2                 # FIXED - cannot modify
      
    - name: "Machine B"
      processing_time_minutes: 7    # BOTTLENECK - Consider reducing
      mtbf_hours: 15                # FIXED - cannot modify
      mttr_hours: 3                 # FIXED - cannot modify
      
    - name: "Machine C"
      processing_time_minutes: 4    # Consider: Already fastest machine
      mtbf_hours: 12                # FIXED - cannot modify
      mttr_hours: 2.5               # FIXED - cannot modify

# Finished Products Storage Parameters
# TODO: Analyze if Machine C is blocked waiting for storage
finished_storage:
  capacity: 50                  # Consider: Increase if blocking occurs

# Logistics Parameters
# TODO: Analyze shipment frequency and delays
logistics:
  lorry_capacity: 20            # Consider: Smaller = more frequent shipments
  driver:
    car_issue_prob: 0.05        # FIXED - cannot modify
    issue_delay_hours: 4        # FIXED - cannot modify
