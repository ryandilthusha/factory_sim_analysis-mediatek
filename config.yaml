# Factory Simulation Configuration - BASELINE
# ============================================
# This is the baseline configuration for the Production Line Optimization Challenge.
# Your task is to analyze this configuration, identify bottlenecks, and create
# an optimized version (config_optimized.yaml) with improved parameters.
#
# NOTE: Parameters marked with (FIXED) cannot be modified as they represent
# equipment characteristics that cannot be changed.

# General Simulation Parameters
simulation:
  duration_hours: 168          # Simulation duration (1 week)
  random_seed: 42              # For reproducibility
  debug_mode: false

# Order Arrival Parameters
order_arrival:
  interarrival_time_hours: 0.15 # Average time between orders (exponential distribution)
  # This means ~6.6 orders per hour on average.
  # Bottleneck (Machine B) capacity is ~8.5 orders/hour.
  # System is running at ~78% capacity, making it sensitive to failures.

# Parts Warehouse Parameters
# MODIFIABLE: You can adjust these to optimize inventory management
parts_warehouse:
  initial_parts: 200            # Starting inventory
  capacity: 500                 # Maximum storage capacity
  replenishment_interval_hours: 12  # How often parts are delivered
  replenishment_quantity: 100   # How many parts per delivery

# Production Line Parameters
production_line:
  # Buffer sizes between machines - MODIFIABLE
  buffer_A_B_size: 5            # Queue capacity between Machine A and B
  buffer_B_C_size: 5            # Queue capacity between Machine B and C
  
  machines:
    - name: "Machine A"
      processing_time_minutes: 5    # MODIFIABLE: Time to process one item
      mtbf_hours: 10                # (FIXED) Mean Time Between Failures
      mttr_hours: 2                 # (FIXED) Mean Time To Repair
      
    - name: "Machine B"
      processing_time_minutes: 7    # MODIFIABLE: Time to process one item
      mtbf_hours: 15                # (FIXED) Mean Time Between Failures
      mttr_hours: 3                 # (FIXED) Mean Time To Repair
      
    - name: "Machine C"
      processing_time_minutes: 4    # MODIFIABLE: Time to process one item
      mtbf_hours: 12                # (FIXED) Mean Time Between Failures
      mttr_hours: 2.5               # (FIXED) Mean Time To Repair

# Finished Products Storage Parameters
# MODIFIABLE: Adjust to balance WIP inventory vs throughput
finished_storage:
  capacity: 30                  # Maximum finished goods storage

# Logistics Parameters
# MODIFIABLE: Adjust shipping frequency and capacity
logistics:
  lorry_capacity: 20            # Products per shipment
  driver:
    car_issue_prob: 0.05        # (FIXED) Probability of vehicle issues
    issue_delay_hours: 4        # (FIXED) Average delay when issues occur

# ============================================
# BASELINE EXPECTED RESULTS (for reference):
# - Throughput: ~6.5 orders/hour
# - Average Lead Time: ~10.0 - 15.0 hours
# - Machine Utilization: B is primary bottleneck (~75-80%)
# - System is highly sensitive to machine failures and buffer sizes.
# ============================================

# OPTIMIZATION HINTS:
# 1. Machine B has the longest processing time (7 min) - this creates a bottleneck.
# 2. Buffer sizes are small (5), causing upstream machines to block during failures.
# 3. Warehouse replenishment (100 every 12h) is tight compared to demand (~80 every 12h).
# 4. Lorry capacity (20) means shipments happen every ~3 hours.
